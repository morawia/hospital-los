    "Phase I (1989–1991) developed and validated a prognostic model for 180-day survival. Phase\n",

    "2. Bias: The model may underperform for certain subgroups (e.g., by age, disease type,\n",
    "comorbidity count, or underrepresented diagnoses). Bias and fairness must be evaluated.\n",
    "3. Ethics: Predictions should support staff and not replace clinical judgment or be misused.\n",
    "A human-in-the-loop is required to ensure ethical alignment.\n",
    "4. Data Drift: SUPPORT data was collected 1989–1994. Clinical practices and patient populations\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Ratio variables:\n",
    "   - BUN/Creatinine ratio, commonly used clinically to distinguish types of renal impairment.\n",
    "   - PaO2/FiO2 ratio categories to measure severity of respiratory failure (e.g., ARDS classification).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Clinically meaningful binary flags:\n",
    "   Examples include hyponatremia (sod < 135), acidosis (ph < 7.35), tachycardia (hrt > 130),\n",
    "   hyperbilirubinemia (bili > 2 mg/dL), or fever (temp >= 38°C). Such variables convert continuous \n",
    "   values into interpretable risk markers.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Combined organ dysfunction indicators:\n",
    "   For example, generating a derived variable that counts the number of organ systems failing based \n",
    "   on thresholds in bilirubin (liver), creatinine (kidney), pafi (lungs), or ph (metabolic function).\n",
    "   This mirrors clinical scoring systems such as SOFA/APACHE.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Age groups:\n",
    "   Transforming continuous age into clinically meaningful bins (e.g., <40, 40–60, 60–75, >75).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Interaction terms:\n",
    "   Potential interactions such as age × APS, scoma × pafi, or cancer status × wblc.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Normalized lab values:\n",
    "   Adjusting creatinine relative to age or sex.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion:\n",
    "Although these derived attributes could provide additional signal, the SUPPORT2 dataset already \n",
    "contains several high-level clinical scores (e.g., APS, SCOMA, SPS). Given the assignment scope and \n",
    "the goal of maintaining interpretability, we decided not to create or apply any derived attributes. \n",
